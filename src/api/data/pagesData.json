Over the last few weeks, we've discussed our vision for this comic at length and have finally decided to *drum roll please* remake the prologue for Monsters & Myriads!! 🥳🥂 The one we have now served its purpose in teaching us a lot of lessons about making comics, but over the next few weeks, we intend to breathe new life into the beginning of our novel, setting more clear expections and setting for the story. We will restart our posting schedule the last monday of the month, January 31.",
