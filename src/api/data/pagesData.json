We decided to archive the old prologue for our patrons over on Patreon, and release a brand, spanking NEW AND IMPROVED prologue crammed with all the lessons we learned in doing the first 50 pages of Monsters and Myriads. \"But, Nathan,\" you may say, \"you aren't going to make any progress if you keep redoing what you've outgrown.\" To which I respond: you're absolutely right. We're going to keep moving after this, promise! Once we post all 7 pages of the new prologue, we'll un-hide the Chapter 1 pages and move on to Chapter 2. So thank you for coming back or starting it fresh! We're so excited and proud of what we're doing, but we are learning everyday how to write/illustrate better. If you have ideas, we'd love to hear them in our Discord! The link is below. :)",
